#### This folder contains Python code for simulating an ideal gas in a 2D box.
- Here we are assuming that initially the atoms have equal magnetude of velocity but different directions and random position values.
- Then we allow them for a while to collide wwith each other.
- THen we see the final veloctiy distribution.

#### Here the calculations for the position and velocity of the atoms are done using C and then simulated using Python.
#### Here the final velocity distribution that we are getting is the Maxwell-Boltzmann Velocity distribution in 2D space.

#### Hi everyone. Iâ€™m very excited to share that during my 1st semester break at TIFR, I tried to build a stellar spectrometer using my old telescope at my home. 
I made a custom eyepiece using a diffraction grating obtained from a laser pointer, and then used my smartphone to take a photo of "Sirius A" through the telescope. 
I then cropped and analyzed the photo using ImageJ software and did all the processing in Python.
I know there are many limitations in this process, such as:

1. The phone camera is not sensitive to red and infrared regions due to the in-built IR filter in it.


2. The resolution is very poor because the object viewed through the eyepiece appears very small. Cropping reduces the resolution further.


3. I know very little about spectrum processingðŸ˜…. I just scaled the spectrum and calibrated it using two spectral dips that I found matching â€” the Hydrogen alpha and Hydrogen gamma lines. The 2nd image is from the Internet.

4. I also have not considered the absorption spectrum of the lens setup of the telescope.

5. Also due to shaking while taking the picture, the image got stretched a bit.


#### Some of the dips matched with the spectrum, while others did not. However, my spectrum looks quite similar to the actual one, so Iâ€™m pretty happy with the first attemptðŸ¤—. Iâ€™ll try to improve on these limitations in the future.

#### Here are all the data filesðŸ‘‡
